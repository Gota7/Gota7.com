# Music

I am currently writing some songs and figuring out the best way to record and master them myself... Coming sometime!

Ok fine, here's an acoustic recording of a song:

## Perfect Angels

```=html
<audio controls>
    <source src="/music/PerfectAngelsAcoustic.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

```
They don't care
Of the color of your hair
Or where you're from
Know not if you are scum

Don't know where you've been
The secrets under your skin
Anything spoken be true
For they do care about you

To them we are
Perfect angels
Nothing more nothing less
Perfect angels
And they couldn't be further off

To them we are
Perfect angels
Nothing more nothing less
Perfect angels
And they couldn't be further off
```
