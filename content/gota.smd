Hello, this is Gota7! I have an interest in all things low-level!
The closer to the hardware a program is, the better.
I currently work in embedded-systems programming.
When I'm not writing code I'm probably playing guitar, watching videos, or maybe drawing (though I rarely do that lol).

Professionally, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and have primarily worked as a Software Engineer.

I started programming in my own free time by learning Javascript on Khan Academy in 6th grade.
After that, I started playing around on my own with the Processing language.
I took an online course to learn C#.
During middle school, I got familiar with the Python language.
I also created [Nitro Studio](https://gota7.github.io/NitroTools/), a sound editor for Nintendo DS sound archives, using C#.

In high school, I learned Java (which I didn't really use for anything), but learned C in my own time (which was more useful).
I later learned C++ and that became my main programming language.
I mostly worked on modding Super Mario 64 DS as well as making tutorials for it on my YouTube channel.

In college, I became more fascinated with low-level programming.
I joined decompilation projects that used Ghidra and other reverse engineering tools
to try and recreate C++ code that when compiled would match GameCube game binaries 1 to 1.
I then started a game dev project in C++ for PC and 3ds for a 3d platformer that is still in progress today.

I started work developing my own programming language named [Asylum](https://asylum-lang-foundation.github.io/Manual/index.html)
using my own higher-level library for LLVM named [WARD](https://github.com/Gota7/WARD-Sharp),
but kept scrapping progress because I was unhappy with its design and thought things could be better.
In fact, the Asylum manual linked I have plenty of problems wrong with its design and wanted to start from scratch again.
However, I was introduced to the zig programming language!
It is the language that I have been dreaming of before I even knew it.
It had all the design goals of my language, but done more concisely and clearer than my vision.
The only catch was that the language had less features, but I found this to be a blessing rather than a curse.
Sometimes less is more.

Now I mainly program in zig and work on open-source zig libraries, as well as developing my own game projects and software.
